		<p id="background">The ideas behind of machine learning are actually quite simple on the surface and they are are. Computers take information from some source. This source can be a database or manual input of data from a person. The computer takes that data and sends it through an algorithm or algorithms to do calculations and returns information to the user. An algorithm is just a set of steps needed to get a result. This can be digital or physical. In terms of machine learning algorithms are mathematical formulas that are programmed into the computer. Those formulas apply the formulas to the data to make predictions and return those predictions to the user. Machine learning does not really have many local or school organizations that necessarily advocate for it. College of Charleston does not even have a machine learning club. Really the only schools that do have clubs that delve into this topic are elite level universities. I will be using a study from Stanford University and analyzing the rhetorical situation of that. Much like how most organizations have exigences, audiences, and constraints, so do research papers. The title of the research paper: Countdown Regression: Sharp and Calibrated Survival Predictions, creates the sense of complexity right off the bat. While the work itself is complicated, finding the exigence, intended audience, and constraints is not nearly as complex. </p>
		
		<p id="exigence">The exigence is explained in the introduction of the paper: there needs to be a probabilistic model that operates at the instant of an event, and can do so accurately. This is a very complex problem. The paper addresses the general work around for this problem, “The most common approach for fitting survival models is via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)...” Then they explain how this can lead to problems. To simplify why this is a problem they say the models can be “overly conservative as a result and predict distributions with very high variance.” They explain the problem with that is sometimes the information returned is not even useful anymore. Healthcare is used as an example here. The authors believe that having access to “accurate and confident predictions,” will allow patients futures to be better realized. The issue is well explained and has many examples to reinforce the shortcomings of previous solutions.  Weather is used as an example as well. “...A rain forecast of 80%, it should actually rain approximately 8 of 10 time,” then proceeds to explain what could go wrong in predictions. If the model is not well calibrated it will make wrong predictions and if it is well calibrated it could also make wrong predictions. The “Sharpness” of a model is now brought up. Sharpness assists the model to make information more useful. <a href='https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/countdown-regression/img/cdr-crps.png'>This image</a> gives a visual of the models to better understand what changes between methods. All the information given is very complex, which assists in finding out the audience.</p>

		<p id="audience">The audience is intended to be high level mathematicians and data scientists. . This is evident from the terminology used in the paper. The introduction is easy to understand but quickly evolves into jumbles of letters and numbers in the next few paragraphs. I am obviously not a part of the intended audience which allows me to see who are. The audience addressed was most likely also people that are very knowledgeable in math or a board of some sort. The audience addressed would be able to act on the findings that the team made, thus making this a rhetorical piece.</p>

		<p id="constraints">As this is a research paper, there are many constraints. One such constraint is the fact that this is a new model. Previous models are more likely to be used because they are more well known. Another constraint is the amount of research done by other organizations. Little amount of research has been published about this method of prediction. Of the small amount that has been published, Andrew Ng, who is involved in this paper, is involved in. The researchers also have to write the paper in terms of the audience will understand. Everyday people will have no idea what this paper means, which is fine because they are not the targeted audience.</p>
	
		<p>This type of paper is typical of the organization. Stanford has many research papers in the machine learning field. The studies are intended to better peoples’ understandings on the topics of study. Generally, they accomplish this. That is assuming you understand the math involved. Publishing research on this topic is becoming of increasing importance. Machine learning is a growing field and is becoming increasingly relevant in our lives. Studies like this help to further the machine learning field. By realizing the problems with current solutions, it helps to improve future methods. Flaws in machine learning algorithms can be fatal. The paper talks about algorithms used in the medical field. Having accurate predictions can determine whether a patient lives or dies. 
			The paper is effective for the targeted audience. It took me more time to understand the research paper than to write my analysis. Luckily, the exigence and audience is clear. The constraints are not as clear but are relatively easy to figure out. The paper thoroughly explains the problem then gives the researchers solution. They use statistics and images to further the audience's understanding of the topic. They also use formulas to show how their solutions will work.</p>
